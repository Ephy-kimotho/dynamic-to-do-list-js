# DYNAMIC TODO LIST

In this project, I have created a todo list app using Vanilaa JS.
This is a project from ALX Frontend web development course where I learnt the following:

- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements using JavaScript.
- Attaching event listeners to handle user interactions.
- Persisting data using localStorage, ensuring that tasks are saved even after the browser is closed.
